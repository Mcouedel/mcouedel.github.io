### My study interest

My research focuses on the study of ecological communities through molecular taxonomy approaches. I am particularly interested by barcoding and metabarcoding approaches to first identify species and communities, and then characterise their evolution and interaction with the environment. 
I am very enthusiastic to develop bioinformatic pipelines to improve reproducibility and make molecular tools accessible to a larger number of researchers. 

### My PhD work

My Ph.D. work focuses on the diversity of the coral reef cryptobiome and its spatio-temporal patterns in the Mascarene Islands (Reunion and Rodrigues). For this, I use artificial micro-reefs ([Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structure, ARMS](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/global-arms-program)) as a standardised sampling method which mimic the reef framework complexity. With the support of molecular taxonomy approaches, I investigate this cryptic reef biodiversity, aiming to understand the factors shaping the colonisation and distribution of this understudied community. This work highlights the uniqueness of Mascarenesâ€™ cryptobiome and the need to develop regional barcode databases to improve knowledge and ecological interpretations in light of global changes.
In addition, I use species delineation and phylogeography to investigate colonisation patterns of cryptobenthic species at larger scales.
